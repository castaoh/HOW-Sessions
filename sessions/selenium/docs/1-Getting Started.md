## What is Selenium?

[Reference Doc](https://selenium.dev/about/)

### Selenium controls web browsers

Selenium is many things but at its core, it is a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available to remotely control browser instances and emulate a user’s interaction with the browser.

It allows users to simulate common activities performed by end-users; entering text into fields, selecting drop-down values and checking boxes, and clicking links in documents. It also provides many other controls such as mouse movement, arbitrary JavaScript execution, and much more.

Although used primarily for front-end testing of websites, Selenium is at its core a browser user agent library. The interfaces are ubiquitous to their application, which encourages composition with other libraries to suit your purpose.

### One interface to rule them all

One of the project’s guiding principles is to support a common interface for all (major) browser technologies. Web browsers are incredibly complex, highly engineered applications, performing their operations in completely different ways but which frequently look the same while doing so. Even though the text is rendered in the same fonts, the images are displayed in the same place and the links take you to the same destination. What is happening underneath is as different as night and day. Selenium “abstracts” these differences, hiding their details and intricacies from the person writing the code. This allows you to write several lines of code to perform a complicated workflow, but these same lines will execute on Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, and all other supported browsers.

### How to get Started

In this session, we'll be using Selenium support in .NET Core.
