# Angular Elements
Angular Elements allow us to build web components which can be consumed by other non-Angular applications. We'll build a web component that allows the user to search for an image using Bing Search and get the url back. Then, we'l consume that web component in our library app and also in a simple html page.

## Areas where Angular Elements could be useful

1. Elements in Apps
